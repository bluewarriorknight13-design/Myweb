# Overview

The Alnership Minecraft Server project is a web-based application that provides a Minecraft-themed interface for server management. The application features a login system with a pixelated, gaming-inspired UI that mimics the aesthetic of Minecraft. It serves as a gateway for users to access server functionality through a browser-based interface.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application uses a single-page architecture with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The frontend is built with:

- **Static HTML structure** - Simple, semantic HTML with Minecraft-themed styling
- **CSS animations** - Custom animations for floating blocks, particles, and background effects
- **Pixel-perfect styling** - Minecraft-inspired visual elements including floating blocks, particles, and retro fonts
- **Responsive design** - Mobile-friendly layout with viewport meta tags

The frontend implements a gaming aesthetic with animated background elements, floating Minecraft blocks, and particle effects to create an immersive experience.

## Backend Architecture
The backend follows a minimal Express.js server pattern:

- **Express.js web server** - Lightweight Node.js server for serving static content
- **Static file serving** - All frontend assets served directly from the file system
- **Single route handling** - Basic routing for the main application page

The server architecture prioritizes simplicity and direct file serving over complex backend logic, suggesting this is primarily a frontend-focused application.

## Authentication System
The current implementation appears to have a basic login interface without backend authentication logic implemented. The system is designed to:

- **Client-side login form** - Username and password input fields
- **Placeholder authentication** - Login functionality referenced but not implemented in visible code

## Design Patterns
- **Static content delivery** - All assets served as static files
- **Component-based styling** - CSS organized around UI components (containers, forms, buttons)
- **Animation-driven UX** - Heavy use of CSS animations for user engagement

# External Dependencies

## Node.js Dependencies
- **Express.js (v5.1.0)** - Web application framework for Node.js
- **serve-static (v2.2.0)** - Static file serving middleware

## Frontend Dependencies
- **Google Fonts** - Press Start 2P font for retro gaming aesthetic
- **Custom CSS animations** - No external animation libraries, all effects built with vanilla CSS

## Development Dependencies
The project uses minimal external dependencies, focusing on lightweight, native web technologies rather than heavy frameworks or complex tooling.
